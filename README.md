# spark
First Apache Spark App on Jupyter Notebooks

This Jupyter Notebook was called from the command line on my pc using 'pyspark' as the prompt after I re-installed Anaconda. The rest of this notebook is taken from https://mas-dse.github.io/DSE230/installation/linux/ and is a Monte Carlo experiment to find an estimate for $\pi$. Investopedia defines Monte Carlo experiments as simulations "used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models."
